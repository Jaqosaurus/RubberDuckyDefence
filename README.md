Rubber Ducky Defence is a basic tower defence game featuring rubber ducks as the creeps.

Built in lua and Love2d for my CS50 final project, 2020.

The aim is to prevent waves of duckies making it across the screen by building towers. Towers cost money, luckily killing duckies earns money.

There are two types of tower (a normal one and a slowing one), and two types of duck (a normal, yellow ducky and a fast, pink ducky). Controls are very simple, left click to build a normal tower, right click for a slowing one which is a little more expensive. There's no mechanism to upgrade or sell towers at the moment.

There are 3 levels with different maps which are built with tiles.  

Each levels sees you faced with 20 waves, the first 18 levels each have 20 duckies in them with the 5th, 10th, 15th and 18th waves being fast duckies. Level 19 is 10 giant yellow boss duckies and level 20 is 50 fast duckies that spawn slightly quicker than usual.

Duckies increase in life every wave, making them harder to kill.

Due to the speed of the fast duckies they are very difficult to hit without using slowing towers, so some strategy is needed.

The ducks are slightly animated, in that their tails wiggle.

There are sound effects for when you kill a duck (a 'pop' noise) and when you lose a life (a rubber duck squeak, there are 3 slightly different squeaks and it randomly picks which one to play. I did experiment with other sounds, such as when projectiles shoot but it annoyed me, similarly I find repetative background music annoying.
